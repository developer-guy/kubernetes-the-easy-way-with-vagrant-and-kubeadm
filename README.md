# Sample cluster with 1 controller and 2 workers

# Prerequisites:
You need to install vagrant and virtualbox in advance for this to work.

# Usage:
For starting the cluster you can do it by running:
```
./up.sh
```
I recommend that you take a look at the `up.sh` to know what it does, then the `Vagrantfile` and then each script to see how you can quickly bootstrap a functional cluster (not production ready, but functional), also be aware that you will need at least 6 Gbs of free memory for the virtual machines.


Coy the kubeconfig to your machine, export its path as an environment variable and test it (give it at least 5 mins for the machines to boot, install everything and are running, you can watch the vagrant log).
```
vagrant ssh cluster1-master1 -c "sudo cat /root/.kube/config" > vagrant-kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/vagrant-kubeconfig"
```

And then test it:
```
‚ùØ kubectl get pods -A -o wide

You should see something like that, it means your cluster is up and running and it is fully functional.
